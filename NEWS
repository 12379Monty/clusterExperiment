Changes in version 0.1.0 (Release date: 2014-08-18)
==============

Changes:

* Conversion to S4 language for bioConductor submission
* All previous functions have been overhauled, renamed, etc.

Changes in version 0.0.0.9006
==============

Changes:

* fixed so that mergeClusters, clusterHclust, and getBestFeatures will appropriately convert if the input of clustering vector is a factor rather than numeric (with warning).
* fixed mergeClusters to have option to indicate that input matrix is a count matrix (in which case will create dendrogram with log(counts+1) and will do getBestFeatures with the voom correction) 
* added more tutoral-oriented vignette (old vignette is now the documentation vignette with more detail about the internal workings of package). Currently is just simulated data, but will be updated to real single-cell sequencing dataset.

Changes in version 0.0.0.9005
==============

Changes:

* Changed simulated data so load all with data(simData) rather than separate calls for simData and simCount. Also added 'trueCluster' vector to give true cluster assignments of simulated data
* added dendro example to getBestFeatures
* added example to clusterHclust
* added single function for converting to phylobase tree (used internally by package)
* added functionality to find proportion of significant null hypotheses for merging clusters (mergeClusters)

Changes in version 0.0.0.9004
==============

Changes:

* Changed clusterMany.R to only set k<-NA if sequential=FALSE (previously for all where findBestK=TRUE)
* Added to vignette
* fixed bug in plotClusters to correctly plot "-1"
