\usage{
getBestGenes(cl, dat, type = c("F", "Dendro", "Pairs"), dendro = NULL,
  pairMat = NULL, returnType = c("Index", "Table"),
  contrastAdj = c("PerContrast", "AfterF", "All"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cl}{A vector with cluster assignments to compare to clRef.``-1'' indicates the sample was not assigned to a cluster.}

\item{dat}{data for the test, samples in rows}

\item{type}{What type of test to do. `F' gives the omnibus F-statistic, `Dendro' traverses the given dendrogram and does contrasts of the samples in each side, and `Pairs' does pair-wise contrasts based on the pairs given in pairMat.}

\item{dendro}{The dendrogram to traverse if type="Dendro". Note that this should be the dendrogram of the clusters, not of the individual samples.}

\item{pairMat}{pairs of clusters for which to do pair-wise contrasts (must match to elements of cl). If NULL, will do all pairwise of the cl (excluding "-1")}

\item{returnType}{Whether to return the index of genes, or the full table given by topTable or topTableF.}

\item{...}{options to pass to \code{\link{topTable}} or \code{\link{topTableF}} (see \code{\link{limma}} package)}

\item{requireF}{whether a significant omnibus F-statistic should be required before testing for significant contrasts (only for option type="Dendro" or "Pairs"). In which case the user must supply an option 'p.value' to be sent to}
}
\details{
getBestGenes returns best genes corresponding to a cluster assignment. It uses limma to fit the models, and limma's functions topTable or topTableF to find the best genes.  See the options of these functions to put better control on what gets returned (e.g. only if significant, only if log-fc is above a certain amount, etc.). In particular, set 'number=' to define how many significant genes to return (where number is per contrast for the 'Pairs' or 'Dendro' option)
